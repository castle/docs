Tracking security events
========================

The more security-related actions you track from your backend, the more
accurate Castle is in identifying fraudsters. It also gives you greater
insight in the Castle dashboard.

You should at least try to track ``$login.succeeded``,
``$login.failed``, and ``$logout.succeeded`` as these are all valuable
signals when it comes to detecting account hijacks and brute-force
attacks.

For more technical documentation please check out our PHP library
<https://github.com/castle/castle-php> or Ruby gem on
GitHub <https://github.com/castle/castle-ruby>.

Tracking
--------

Event names and detail properties that have semantic meaning are
prefixed ``$``, and we handle them in special ways.

Step 1: Track successful logins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have access to a **logged in user**, set ``user_id`` to the
same user identifier as when you initiated Castle.js.

.. code-block:: ruby

    castle.track(
      name: '$login.succeeded',
      user_id: user.id
    )

.. code-block :: php

    <?php

    Castle::track(array(
      'name' => '$login.succeeded',
      'user_id' => $user->id
    ));

    ?>

.. code-block:: java

    // TBD

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://api.castle.io/v1/events \
      -X POST \
      -u :gBQokikJOvH4olfBiI2HlWQ2 \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Castle-Cookie-Id: a97b492d-dcc3-4fc1-87d6-65682955afa5" \
      -H "X-Castle-Ip: 37.46.187.90" \
      -H "X-Castle-Headers: {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\", \"Accept\": \"text/html\", \"Accept-Language\": \"en-us,en;q=0.5\"}" \
      \
      -d '{"name": "$login.succeeded", "user_id": "1234"}'

Track ``$logout.succeeded`` in the same way.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- Check out the [REST docs](https://api.castle.io/docs#request-context) on how to configure the headers. -->

Step 2: Track failed logins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you don't have access to a logged in user, just omit ``user_id``.
Instead, whenever you have access to the user-submitted form value, add
this to the event details as ``$login``.

.. code-block:: ruby

    castle.track(
      name: '$login.failed',
      details: {
        '$login' => 'johan@castle.io'
      }
    )

.. code-block:: php


    <?php

    Castle::track(array(
      'name' => '$login.failed',
      'details' => array(
        '$login' => 'johan@castle.io'
      )
    ));

    ?>

.. code-block:: java

    // TBD

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://api.castle.io/v1/events \
      -X POST \
      -u :gBQokikJOvH4olfBiI2HlWQ2 \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Castle-Cookie-Id: a97b492d-dcc3-4fc1-87d6-65682955afa5" \
      -H "X-Castle-Ip: 37.46.187.90" \
      -H "X-Castle-Headers: {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\", \"Accept\": \"text/html\", \"Accept-Language\": \"en-us,en;q=0.5\"}" \
      \
      -d '{"name": "$login.failed", "details": {"$login": "johan@castle.io"}}'
